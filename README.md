# fraud-detection-capstone

This is our final-year capstone project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. We tackle the **class imbalance problem** using resampling and cost-sensitive learning, and compare various models to find the most effective fraud detection strategy.
