I used Robust Scaler as a data normlazation method; it is a better appraoch than Min-Max because our data has outliers and if we use Min-Max then it will mess with SMOTE's output.

To clone this code, run:

git clone --single-branch --branch preprocessing_v3 https://github.com/Zuleykhaha/fraud-detection-capstone.git , if you haven't cloned anything from this repositry yet.

If you have cloned this repositry, then run:
git fetch origin preprocessing_v3
git switch preprocessing_v3

Note: I used os path and based it on a structure I created on my machine, but the data file in my machine was too large to upload to GitHub so to run the code download the CSV file from main repositry
and define the paths as needed.
